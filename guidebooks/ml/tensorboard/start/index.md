# Run The Tensorboard Server

[Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started#:~:text=TensorBoard%20is%20a%20tool%20for,dimensional%20space%2C%20and%20much%20more.) is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow. It enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph, projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space, and much more.

=== "Run Locally"
