# Port-forward to the Tensorboard server

```shell
export TENSORBOARD_PORT=${TENSORBOARD_PORT-$(shuf -i 8266-9999 -n1)}
```

```shell.async
kubectl --context ${KUBE_CONTEXT} -n ${KUBE_NS} port-forward service/tensorboard-service ${TENSORBOARD_PORT}:9080 > /tmp/port-forward-tensorboard
```

```shell
echo "ðŸ‘‰ $(tput setaf 6)Tensorboard URL: $(tput bold)http://localhost:${TENSORBOARD_PORT}$(tput sgr0)"
```

## Wait for the Tensorboard port forwarder to become active

```shell
while true; do if [ -f /tmp/port-forward-tensorboard ] && [ "$(cat /tmp/port-forward-tensorboard | grep -q 'Forwarding from' && echo 1 || echo 0)" = "1" ]; then break; sleep 1; fi; done
```

## Wait, if requested

In some debugging cases it might be useful to wait for a bit. TODO:
this really should be wait, if we are executing this as a top-level
guidebook. That is, if the user only wants to set up the port
forwarding, then we shouldn't exit. This is the hack for now: set
`WAIT=true` when running this guidebook in this scenarios.

```shell
if [ -n "$WAIT" ]; then sleep 100000; fi
```
