# Codeflare Training Applications

The process of training an ML model involves providing an ML algorithm
(that is, the learning algorithm) with training data to learn
from. The term ML model refers to the model artifact that is created
by the training process.

## Which training application do you want to run?

=== "Train a Masked Language Model"

    The [CodeFlare](https://codeflare.dev/) [model architecture](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/cc-machine-learning-deep-learning-architectures/) uses [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta), which
    is a robustly optimized method for pretraining natural language
    processing (NLP) systems.
