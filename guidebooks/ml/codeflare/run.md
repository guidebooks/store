# Project Codeflare: Run a Job

I would like to configure and fire off a run.

## What kind of application do you want to run?

=== "Run with CodeFlare Model Architecture"
    
    The [CodeFlare](https://codeflare.dev) project offers a curated
    collection of optimized source code and pre-trained models that you
    can leverage to expedite your time to value.

    This path provides a way for you to run your own custom code on a remote ray cluster.
