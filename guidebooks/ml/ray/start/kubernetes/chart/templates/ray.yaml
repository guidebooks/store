# This AppWrapper resource informs the Multi-cluster App Dispatcher as
# to which resources we want it to schedule
#    https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher
#
# - Service for head node
# - Deployment to manage the head node
# - Deployment to manage the worker nodes
# - PodGroup to manage the pods of those deployments (only if the coscheduler is enabled)
#
# Th coscheduler prevents situations where multiple simultaneous jobs
# are "all heads, no workers", because we arrange the pods for the
# heads+workers into a podgroup that the coscheduler schedules as a
# "gang", i.e. don't schedule any of the pods in a gang, if the
# minimum viability for that gang cannot currently be achieved.
