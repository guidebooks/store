# Choose Pod Scheduler for MCAD

If you run many unrelated jobs concurrently, use the [Multi-Cluster
Application Dispatcher
(MCAD)](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher) with the
advanced
[coscheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/pkg/coscheduling/README.md). MCAD
can be configured to prioritize your workloads.

=== "My administrator has already installed and configured MCAD"

    If you are a non-admin user in a multi-tenant cluster, select this option.
    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_MANAGER=mcad
    ```

    TODO: here we assume that the coscheduler is installed.
    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_SCHEDULER=${KUBE_POD_SCHEDULER-coscheduler}
    ```

    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_MANAGER_NON_ROOT=true
    ```

    :import{./job-priority}

=== "MCAD with the Advanced Coscheduler"

    The [coscheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/pkg/coscheduling/README.md)
    helps avoid livelock, where multiple jobs compete for resources in a
    way that prevents any of them from making progress. 
    *Requires root privileges to your cluster.*

    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_MANAGER=mcad
    ```

    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_SCHEDULER=coscheduler
    ```

    :import{ml/ray/hacks/openshift/uid-range}
    :import{kubernetes/coscheduler/install}
    :import{kubernetes/mcad/install}

=== "MCAD with the Default Kubernetes Scheduler"

    If you do not wish to use the experimental
    coscheduler, select this option.
    *Requires root privileges to your cluster.*

    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_MANAGER=mcad
    ```

    ```shell
    export KUBE_POD_SCHEDULER=default
    ```

    :import{ml/ray/hacks/openshift/uid-range}
    :import{kubernetes/mcad/install}
