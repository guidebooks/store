# Target Kubernetes Namespace for Ray Cluster

The bit of complexity here is intended to handle the situation where
we are running in a restricted OpenShift environment. In some such
cases, we do not have access to the `Namespace` APIs, but we do have
access to the `Project` APIs. In OpenShift, normally the two are the
same, but in a restricted environment, a Project can act as a
Namespace, without the additional security concerns that Namespaces
bring.

    > If we are faking a project for tests, then don't use a `-n <namespace` CLI argument for subsequent `kubectl` commands.
