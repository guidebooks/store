# Install tensorboard

[Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) TensorBoard
provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning
experimentation:

- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
- Displaying images, text, and audio data
- Profiling TensorFlow programs
- And much more

```shell
