# Guidebook Demos

Welcome to the world of guidebooks. A guidebook is a **markdown** file
that has been vetted, e.g. via
[madwizard](https://github.com/guidebooks/madwizard), to help guide
users through tasks. This means that it is possible to sequence users
through a series of **choices**, and that it is possible to validate
whether sub-tasks are truly needed for any given user. Using
[madwizard](https://github.com/guidebooks/madwizard), the
documentation can also be run through automated tests, ensuring that
it works, and continues to do so. Here are some simple demos,
presented as a guidebook!

## Your first choice

=== "A simple Hello World"
    :import{./hello}
